You need to have Docker and docker compose installed on your device.

Before starting the application, copy the files 

- [db.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnB43OQrPZAuC4CG9U0hzCnN3fV7t2_3/view?usp=drive_link) and [nyt.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oodDslsXbQEkNT_JPbDOQHqu1_OPnhV8/view?usp=drive_link) into the folders **airflow/project_secrets** and 

- [db.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnB43OQrPZAuC4CG9U0hzCnN3fV7t2_3/view?usp=drive_link) into **Visualization/udoCloud/static**

To start the application, run on you windows machine 

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

or

```sh
